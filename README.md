## General info
2022 NASA SPACE APPS CHALLENGE  
Challenge: LEARNING THROUGH THE LOOKING GLASS  
Team: The Space Runner  

Mind Mirror is a game to help people learn about the James Webb Space Telescopeâ€™s powerful capabilities while understanding their inner minds at the same time. The first step is, Know Yourself, a video introducing the features of the JWST. The second step is, Explore Potentials, a personality test with music and photos that guides people to roam in the universe. People may have a peek at the unknown side of their souls through this test. The final step is the game, Bricks Breaker, which symbolizes people crossing the limits of each level by breaking bricks. And get the whole picture of those amazing photos after success, just like JWST reveals previously hidden regions of the universe. To sum up, Mind Mirror is an interactive and educational game to help people know themselves better. Following the three steps mentioned above, people may achieve self-improvement and self-growth which could positively affect their career and personal life.
